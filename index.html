        <h2>Zo&euml; Hall</h2>
        <p>My full name is Zo&euml; Nichole Elizabeth Xion Faith Hall. 
            I love the arts. I'm a singer, actor, writer and I am a part of a performing arts group
            called Tribe Sankofa. One day I would love to be able to dance.
            I am in (hopefully) my final year at UWI. I am a Computer Science Major, minoring
            in Psychology (and possibly also in Human Resource Management). I consider myself
            a perfectionist, however I am at times a huge procrastinator. My dream is to one day own
            a hotel. I am interested in Web Development because I think it's really awesome skill to have.
            I hope to learn a lot and have fun whilst doing so.</p>

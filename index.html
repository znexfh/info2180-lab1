        <p>My full name is Zo&euml; Nichole Elizabeth Xion Faith Hall. 
            I love the arts.<br> I'm a singer, actor, writer and I am a part of a performing arts group
            called Tribe Sankofa.<br> One day I would love to be able to dance.<br><br>
            I am in (hopefully) my final year at UWI. <br>I am a Computer Science Major, minoring
            in Psychology (and possibly also in Human Resource Management).<br> I consider myself
            a perfetionist, however I am at times a huge procrastinator. My dream is to one day own
            a hotel.</p>
